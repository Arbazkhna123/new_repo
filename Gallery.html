      <h2>Saylani  Introduction</h2>
       <p>Saylani Welfare International Trust has been working for the last 22 years to improve the conditions of the less privileged, helpless, and handicapped individuals. The organization is working day and night to make life happier, especially for the middle class, lower middle class and even lower class. At time of establishing the organization, the founder of Saylani Welfare International Trust and a few of his associates had made a commitment to serve the distressed people living in Pakistan and abroad in all stages of life. It is a blessing in disguise that today the organization is serving humanity in more than 63 areas of life without any discrimination.</p>
      <p>Hazrat Allama Maulana Muhammad Bashir Farooq, a distinguished spiritual figure and Islamic scholar, serves as the guiding force, founder, and patron of this organization. Through his dedicated efforts, Saylani Welfare International Trust has become a global humanitarian entity, extending its service to humanity worldwide.</p>
      <p>Originating in a rented house, the organization has grown to encompass over 630 branches globally, accompanied by an equal number of Dastarkhwans, employing thousands. Presently, the organization allocates an monthly budget exceeding a billion for humanitarian services. Encompassing more than 63 facets of life from birth to death, mobile air care clinics, and operation theaters, our organization is dedicated to serving humanity, especially during natural disasters.</p>
